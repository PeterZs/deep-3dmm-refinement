# Deep 3D morphable model refinement via progressive growing of conditional Generative Adversarial Networks

This page contains end-to-end demo code to recover accurate and detailed reconstructions of the facial shape from an unconstrained 2D face image. For a given input image, it generates a standard obj file. The approach is described in our paper [1].

## Dependencies

* cmake
* dlib
* face-alignment
* opencv-python
* scipy==1.1.0
* scikit-image
* tensorflow

Dependencies can be installed by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
